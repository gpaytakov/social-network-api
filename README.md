# Social Network API

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. This small project use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important to understand how to build and structure the API first.

This challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I will also optionally use a JavaScript date library of my choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

I've created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.
